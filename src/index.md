### Plot in the Cloud with ScottPlot

**This figure is an example of ScottPlot running in the cloud.** Every hour an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) hits the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to get an updated list of stargazers, then uses ScottPlot to create a figure from this data and saves it to web-accessible blob storage. Since this automatically-generated plot is just a static image accessible by a URL, it can be displayed in places where JavaScript is not permitted (like in this readme file). Creating plots as images on a server allows dynamic plots to be displayed in many interesting places!
